Introduction 
------------
The Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change is the collective approach of federal, provincial, and territorial governments towards climate change mitigation. Development of a net-zero energy ready model building code for new buildings and an alteration of existing buildings code are among the commitments in the framework. Conventional approaches for code renewal that were mainly focused on incremental improvements of new construction requirements may not satisfy these ambitious new goals.
A typical net zero energy building incorporates a combination of energy saving measures, high efficiency energy technologies, and renewable energy generation.  Advances in renewable/alternative energy technologies, and innovations in building envelope design, provide a large number of options for design and operation of net zero energy buildings. As such, the design of an economically sound net zero energy building is a multifaceted and complicated problem. 
Local authorities scrutinize the cost effectiveness of future codes, which is often dependent on how reliably and cost-effectively energy savings can be achieved through improved technology and building construction. As codes are renewed to prescribe deeper energy savings, they may impose greater capital investment and greater risk that the energy benefits will not be realized.
These risks impede effective renewal of the codes. Authorities will be reluctant to adopt future codes that may impose unintended consequences on homeowners or the construction industry. And if adopted, future codes that increase capital costs while failing to deliver promised changes will erode public trust in the building code and enforcement authorities.

Housing technology assessment platform (HTAP) 
------------
The Housing Technology Assessment Platform (HTAP), developed to identify optimized techno-economically feasible approaches for housing design, can be used for code analysis. HTAP brings together building performance simulation (BPS) software, building stock data, energy conservation measures, rulesets and energy targets, economic data, and cloud computing to analyze numerous technology combinations and identify optimized design scenarios.
HTAP incorporates a house-as-a-system approach where every design scenario is modeled as a complete house in an annual energy analysis. HTAP uses HOT2000 [1] and ESP-r [2] as its building simulation engines. 
Currently, HTAP uses archetypes from variety of sources for various applications. To be compatible with HTAP, an archetype should be developed with HOT2000v11 or later. The majority of existing archetypes was adopted from previous works or local builders across Canada.
HTAP allows the user to apply energy conservation measures to each archetype, and evaluate the cumulative impact of several upgrades in each location. A unique feature of HTAP is the built-in ruleset and energy targets. This feature automatically applies the requirements of codes and energy conservation programs on each archetype to evaluate the impact of those rulesets on energy performance of new houses.
HTAP uses cost data from the Local Energy Efficiency Partnerships (LEEP) program [3] to estimate the cost of energy upgrades. Local energy prices are used to estimate the operating cost of each resulting house. In addition, HTAP provides tools to conduct sensitivity analyses on energy prices and cost analysis of conservation measures.
HTAP generates techno-economic data such as energy savings, GHG emissions, investment costs, and operating cost savings for each measure. Results can be analyzed to identify the maximum possible energy savings and GHG emissions reduction for a given investment cost. In addition, it will indicate potential paths to the net zero energy status for individual archetypes in each region.
HTAP builds upon traditional energy simulation. It uses new approaches, data sets and methods to optimize building design. Therefore, HTAP can make code analysis faster, more regional and more comprehensive. HTAP is a research-oriented tool. It is available to housing energy researchers and consultants who are willing to dedicate the time to become fluent in programming and stock modeling.
